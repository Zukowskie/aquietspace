      What the hell am I doing?
<br>
<br>I'm going crazy. Ever since I first got pulled into this whole ordeal, =
ever since <a href=3D"http://www.dionaea-house.com/">Mark's first email to =
me</a>, I've been spiraling. Now I'm struggling just to separate the facts =
from the fog, the real from the unreal. For weeks, I've been trying to keep=
 his disappearance (and everything trailing after that) at arm's length, an=
d I've failed. I'm an absolute mess. I don't know what to think. I can't he=
lp the Condrys or Jen anymore than I already am, yet I feel wholly inadequa=
te to answer their questions. The truth is I simply don't know. I don't. I =
wish I did. The one person who can answer them has been missing since Septe=
mber 21, and it's possible he lied to me about what he was doing.
<br>
<br>And to make matters worse, I can't even lean on Connie. She doesn't lik=
e the fact that I keep updating Mark's site, or that I'm talking to Jen in =
the middle of the night. But I don't think she understands. The questions s=
he asks, they're always centered around Jen, and what I was talking about o=
n the phone. I know that tone of hers. In the midst of this terrifying orde=
al, she thinks I'm cheating on her!
<br>
<br>I can't dump my thoughts and feelings on the site I made for Mark -- to=
o many people (including Jen and Connie) are paying attention now. And when=
 I've called Cam, he's been more interested in the crazy theories than how =
I'm feeling. The email box I set up for questions by Mark's family is now f=
looded with messages from total strangers, some of them a little too eager =
to help. Or maybe I'm just paranoid now.
<br>
<br>I need a place to unload all these things weighing me down. And, as I h=
ave come to appreciate so well in the last month -- a place to record event=
s in my life. This is just for me. A little sanctuary, or maybe a confessio=
nal.
<br>
<br>Here's something I haven't told Connie yet, nor Jen for that matter. Ye=
sterday morning when I took out the trash, I saw a man standing at the othe=
r end of the alley, over on the La Brea side. Just standing there, staring =
at me. He was wearing this sweatsuit like a jogger wears, it looked dirt-st=
ained, and his hair was unkempt. I tried not to stare back. I think he may =
be homeless.
<br>
<br>This morning I saw him again, down by Olympic. Just standing and starin=
g at me as I drove by.
<br>
<br>Christ, I'm going out of my mind, I just know it.

        <p>You aren't going insane Eric, but I fear what will happen to you=
 if you get too close. I'm probably overdramatizing. Ignore me. If you need=
 someone to talk to, feel free to e-mail me at zantheman@gmail.com or over =
AIM at xSn4k3Ch4rm3rx. God I hope you didn't make all this up. Yea, the par=
