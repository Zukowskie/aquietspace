      Jen! Where are you, and why haven't you answered your cell?
<br>
<br>I don't see how you would check here before checking voicemail, but jus=
t in case, call me. I got home from work at about 7pm, and saw Sweatsuit Ma=
n driving out of the alley, in his pickup. I don't know if I was just fed u=
p, or suspicious, but this time I followed him. It was night and I felt tha=
t I could follow at a reasonable distance without drawing much attention. I=
f he knew my car, it would've been harder to identify at night. Anyway.
<br>
<br>He drove north on Highland and entered the 101 westbound. We stayed on =
the freeway all the way to the 405, where he merged north, for the valley. =
There was some heavy traffic there, and for a few minutes I couldn't see th=
e pickup, but I found him again as we passed Victory.
<br>
<br>He exited Sherman Way and headed east. Then I got stuck at a light at t=
he Northridge med center and lost him again. I just kept driving and lookin=
g. I thought I saw a pickup take a right on a residential street and follow=
ed. I had no idea where I was, no way to write down the street names. I hav=
e Mapquest open in another window right now, I'm narrowing it down, trying =
to recognize familiar names.
<br>
<br>I had gotten lost after taking too many zig-zags, chasing after tail li=
ghts. Some of the stop signs had no street labels. Just an unmarked interse=
ction. But I know the general area. And I made my way back to the freeway. =
I can retrace my steps in the daylight.
<br>
<br>I found the house, Jen. And the pickup. It's the same house. The lights=
 weren't on but I could see it well enough under the streetlamp. Same floor=
plan, same elevation. Not sure if the gate had a plank missing, it was too =
dark. But it's the one.
<br>
<br>I called Cameron as soon as I got to a place where I had a signal again=
. He's on his way over. Connie is at her mother's this weekend. I think we'=
re going to go over tomorrow, middle of the day, and confront the man. I'll=
 round up anyone else I can, too. Power in numbers.
<br>
<br>If, given the chance, we can enter the house, I'm undecided. I want to =
be able to put a stop to this madness, to expose or explain it, and that ma=
y require going inside and facing the madness.
<br>
<br>But this time, we won't be unprepared.
